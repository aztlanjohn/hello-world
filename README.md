# hello-world

This is John. I'm the senior Atlassian admin here and I'm testing how the new Github integration works. Which means I first have to test how Github itself works. (!)

Now I'm adding a new line to see if I can add a comment to a Jira ticket.

New edits. This is in Branch number dos. 
But I forgot to add a note for the ticket. Doing that now.

Ok, this commit won't use a Jira issue key, to see what happens, or doesn't.
It didn't. 

This one will use a Jira issue key, but no comment command.
That worked!

Ok, what about time logging - this "extended description" will include a time log.
